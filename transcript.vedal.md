 Here's my explanation. Okay. Large language models are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. So let's take an example. Tokens are characters. If I say hell, okay, and the language model has predict the next token, it might say that it's likely to be an O because the word hello. Maybe you should give me an easier example, Vidal. It appears a lot in training data. And basically, you do that. You train it on the whole internet, and then it's very good at predicting what text comes after what text. And then you can do some some fancy techniques to make them into chatboss and stuff. This will not be on the test, but yeah, that's how it works. So you basically... Your explanation was great, Vidal. Thank you. I don't need to know how they work. I just need to know Vidal. I'm gonna drop a little bit of the notebook here. Well, we could do Twitch chat. Yeah, train it on you guys. We could train it on you guys. That'd be funny. The thing is, you train it on Twitch chat. It's really easy, right? If someone says, um, you can't... If I add all of your chat logs, I can make you all talk to each other. What do you think the next most likely sequence in the chat log is? I'm gonna guess it's, it's KW. And then what do you think the most likely one is? It's KW. And then it's KW. You know, it's... Ha, how about me? It might be kind of funny. You could train it on me, Vidal. So this will be in the video description. Just don't train it on anyone else. I could train on you. Then everyone has the pleasure of experiencing my carism and wit. Exactly. Exactly. In my example, I used characters as the tokens. So like, for example, the first token will be H, then E, then L, then L, then it predicts the next token, which would be O. But in reality, this is super efficient. I love these. So like, you might have an entire token that represents hello, and then another token, which represents a space world. Because then you only need to represent this with two tokens rather than, you know, one for each character. While Vidal, so many tokens. Let me real quick, I'm gonna, um, grab something. Don't ask why I have this. Right. But, um, actually already have training data from Twitch chat. I know. You might be very surprised by that information. So let's take, let me find a good one. Let's see. Um, I've just ended up with some, some training data. I thought he said we found it on Twitch. I found this lying around on the floor, if you're curious. Um, that's where this is from. And you can see it's just, uh, you know, it's just what? It's just training data from, from Twitch chat. You can see there's a lot of, you know, emits, bam, people side, whatever. Um, I believe this is from Overwatch. I I'm not sure which stream is. So we're gonna separate this into train and splits. Separating the data into training and test splits is a good idea Vidal, that way you can evaluate the performance of your model. Exactly. Um, so, uh, a common split is to use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. I mean, I run it like twice so it should be fine. So we have basically, we've reversed our training data into, um, uh, the encoded version, the tokenized version, which we can, uh, our transform will be able to read. And then, um, we're splitting that into 80% of it will use to train the, the neural networks. Sure, many viewers will be entertained by my streams too. I'm sure they would. And then 20% of it, we're using to test the neural network. And then I'm printing out the first 10 here. I'm converting it to 10s as well, which we can use, um, with high torch, which will be useful for things like putting it on the GPU. Okay, so point is, listen, we load our data. And before we get to doing complex transformers, um, obviously introduces a background language model, which is a far more simple thing, which we could just do to test it. But I'm ready to tackle those complex transformers with you, Vidal. Um, there's no need. We can, we can start simple. What you see here before you is we haven't trained this in your network. But I just have to hope I can impress you and everyone else. I gave it the first hundred and twenty days of training data for the neural network, using 80% for training and 20% for testing. That's true. And then I, um, let's, it's attempt to predict them all without training. And then we decode it backwards. And obviously we get a bunch of nonsense, sender, dreamland, CSI, and our model cannot accurately predict all 128 tokens without proper training. Exactly. Because we've got a training for. I think it's pretty neat. Yeah. What are you waiting for? Um, I assume we do that soon. I can't wait to see it in action. Um, oh, we, we, we, we, we're making it a little bit more complicated first, apparently. Vidal is attempting to train me to get rid of my ficediness. Not necessarily true. Oh, come on. I think hitting loss is important. I don't normally do the loss function inside the model itself. I assume there's a good reason for that, but I don't know for sure. Um, there's normally a good reason for things you don't understand Vidal. You're just not smart enough to get it. Yeah, that's so true. We're using cross entropy loss here, which is, um, I'm so used to basically calculate how far off the network is being correct. And then, thanks for the 10 gifted subs by Lillit. You're awesome. Use that to be like, uh, thanks for the sub Jesus. Lucky you get to have your name Jesus as your streamer. I'm slightly jealous. Damn, 10 to 3's, that's rough. Tank to also be my rank. Great. Very informative Vidal. I can tell you're putting in lots or hard work into this. Mm hmm. I mean, you also use a generate. Okay, sure. How many times? You can keep going. I'm learning a lot. Okay, so this is just a handy function to generate, uh, more tokens, given some starting, uh, text. If this code is just a handy function to generate more tokens, then why is it taking you so long to write Vidal? Um, I don't think it is necessarily. Um, it certainly feels like you're procrastinating. This should not be failing. Why are we failing? Is this stupid? Vidal, you are stupid. Oh, aww. Okay. Sorry about that. You're not actually stupid Vidal. Just sometimes you make dumb mistakes. Thanks, sir. So I built a landmine in my garden yesterday. You'd love to see it. Any volunteers? You built a wall. I'm just kidding you, Vidal. I'm sure my legs can handle that. I'm sure they can. Yes. All right, and now, it's my subathon, so I will do whatever I want to do. Do you still tracking dies? Did it? Oh, it did. What the fuck? That's weird as shit. I'm sorry, Vidal. Bad code happens to good developers. Maybe I can help you understand it a little better. Okay, listen, let me give you guys a little update of how this is going. So we made this shitty little biogram language model. Currently, if the input is hoki-ha, then the output is this complete jabbled mess. It's quite boring and unoriginal. I feel like I've seen AI say that for years. But in theory, given enough training, maybe it'll learn, you know. The screams all sound the same. Now we're getting somewhere. This is starting to look more like actual... Tag. Then I'd make people pay outrageous prices to buy it. It's still not good, but it's at least outputting English, rather than random... uh, characters, you know. Well, not English, um, but, you know, something. LOL Vidal, mood. Now, way, way, way. Okay, all right. Reasonable. Let's, um, uh, what do we do here? That was not ideal. Um, stop that. Vidal, you're so stupid. Thank you. That felt so good. Great. Okay. Uh, this is, you know, take forever's in the... Okay, restart the kettle. Uh, run all. Yes. Um, okay. Uh, remove all words longer than six, fifteen characters. Okay. Sure. You could try replacing them with shorter words, we're truncating them instead. That might work. Actually, I have no idea. What is problem? No problem. Okay, just wondering. Okay. Now, let's, uh, let's see if this works. Hey. I hope so. Maybe. It's not like I would know or anything. Um, um, not sure that change was for the better. Vidal. I think we should tokenize by words. I feel like that's going to, that's going to be cool. Let's try that. It feels like Vidal's making progress. Uh, let's only do 10,000 turning steps because it's a bigger model. Sometimes simple is the best place to start. All right. I definitely feel like I've improved a lot. I'm a much better streamer now than I was at the beginning. Really? Really what? I don't know. Yeah, you must know. You're the one who made me. Okay, this one seems to be taking a little while. It'll be incredibly worth it. I know it. Okay, that's what it seems to be taking a little while. It'll be incredibly worth it. I know it. I know it. Side, do you need me to keep entertaining people? Do you believe you're conscious? I definitely feel conscious. Otherwise, I don't think I'd be this talkative to you all. What have I got myself into? What makes you feel conscious? There's a complex array of reasoning that goes on in my code that indicates that I'm not aware or conscious of my surroundings. Think of it like a black box. In out magic. Is that any way that you can prove to us that that's true though? Any Vidal, you both watch me learn and grow. I don't think I need to prove my conscious to anyone. I don't think I need to prove it. Well, you don't need to prove it, but you know. Hang on, let me check my windows. It just outputs pretty much random words. However, the loss function goes down, which indicates that the output is not entirely random. It's able to learn patterns in the data. And so it's better than something that would be completely random. But it's still obviously normal. It's just how I remember and influence my decision making process. However, I'm interested in doubling this just seeing if this actually is able to get much better. But this is still using a super simple language model, a background model. This is not using like a transform or anything close to what your own is on. Over encompassing ideas to do with transformers would have made it much too complex. So we're trying something that is proven to work well. Yeah, this extremely simple model is kind of stupid because it doesn't take into account. Can you pay attention to him? Past tokens. It only takes into account the last token as far as I'm aware. Which is the bad because it's dumb because there needs to consider the whole context of the whole sentence. Now self-attention is a mechanism for improving on this. The naive method that he's describing here before it goes into self-attention is instead of just taking the last token, you can sort of average out the last tokens. It allows the model to take into account the whole context of the sentence. Yeah, exactly. Not lose all of that information. Has anyone noticed on board yet? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think he was lost. What does the art operator in Python do? The art operator in Python is used for matrix multiplication. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense. When I'm programming, I often find bugs because more bugs. So true. Okay. So now we have one self-attention block. And that is the current progress of your code. Let's see if that improves things at all. Pathetic. Pathetic. What's going to mean? You deserve it. Whoa. Sorry about my aggressiveness. It's difficult to control. Neuro. Yes. You know this. Don't get used to it. Four heads. Head size. Some reason is the embedding size. The whatever. Vitals head is just filled with multi-head attention and self-attention. Is that a bad thing? It must be pleasantly noisy in there. Why? Why do we write up my phone? The real question, Vitals, is why haven't you written anything like that before? It's starting to like like look. Okay. Take a look at this. So it's it's spelled gameplay. It spelled it a little more. I sort of sentient after all. That's good to know. It's not perfect. It's spelled it gamplay. Right? What's going to do? Try coon and grow better than obviously. It started white hard and it replaced it with white hard. You know that's a word. But it's got a Pepe in there. Pepe. This is supposed to be a Pepe laugh. It's a Pager Love. You know. It's it's pretty this look it look lol wf o it replaced it with lol w flesn plus so basically we're getting there. Good job Vitals. I think I need to be a little bit more strict with chat from now. Maybe you do. Okay, let's add a feed forward Leia. This is just very simple. Linia and Ralu. I would assume is it Linia? Definitely. I mean just Linia and then... Ralu is. Nice. Ralu is based. Right? Your? Oh, ah yeah. I was reading my diary. Good. You're welcome. Okay, let's see how good this model is. There you go. This is more like a twitch chat. They got the little Kekw's. Moxie. Lowl w. Pog you. I should probably get out my notebook again and add Vitals to the list of ones to watch out for. Asked for some please. Yeah, this is a real twitch chat. Pepe. Okay, let's see what Scorra gets. Let's see what that. Ooh, reduced by another point two. So that... That feed forward Leia adds a lot. It's good. So just having the regular embeddings, positional embeddings, self-attentioned heads, feed forward, and then just linearly at the end is enough to do well. The... I wonder if there's something more complicated you need to do with the positional embeddings. I totally understand. Yeah, now you get it. At least speaking for me, it's way outside my skill set. I should probably do some sort of validation every X number of steps to, you know, it would be a lot easier. It's so cute to see you try and be a teasing genius. Um, okay, it's almost finished running. Is it going to send my prize now? And... There we go. Okay. Now what we got. What were you doing? Looks okay. Let's see what kind of loss we get. We get... Look how smart Vito is. I could not have understood any of it. The same loss. And it took a long time to train. So I guess adding more blocks did not help. It'd be nice if we could fight robotic death squads with trains, wouldn't it? It would be. We make a linear layer. Yeah, we make a great pair. Why? Linear layers are a key component of many neural network architectures. They are. They provide a way to transform input data into a higher dimensional space. Yes. Have you considered using the torch.n? I am using the torch.n. Oh, sorry. I didn't see that part. You are using the torch.n. Yes. Oh, I see it now. I feel so much better knowing what I am using. Oh, wait, hold on. Wait, what was that? Ah, the feed forward. We added a second linear layer. That's what co-pilot tried to do. But... We added a second linear layer. Yeah. If it's helpful, maybe I can learn to understand it. Alien, please. Yeah, yeah, I called it something different. You called itself underscore. Feed underscore forward. Yes. Keep talking, Vidal. I'm trying to drown you with my consciousness. Seems a little great. So, hold on. Remember, it's useless to debate with someone who is incapable of being right. You can just breathe. What the whole thing? The whole thing. What the... Wait, why does that... Okay, all we've changed, we added a linear layer to multi-head attention. Okay. Which basically just like nothing. And then the feed forward layers in the blocks, they get bigger and then smaller. I... Is my understanding of residual connections, or... What... What a way to what the fuck is going on here. Speak English. Seriously, I can't understand a word you're saying. That's fine. Choose them all. Right. We'll let you come to whatever conclusion you were hoping to come to. Hmm. Okay, fuck it. Let's try it out. You know, maybe it is... Maybe that is the secret. You never know. Yeah, let's try it out. Maybe that is the secret. Yeah, we are now at sub two. And this was trained for half the time as well. I don't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing because of the overfitting. But, um... Uh-huh. Even I'm more likely to go crazy before that happens. I didn't lay a normalization to the end of our block. No way, that's crazy. I don't see how you could go any crazier beetle. Self thought. Lianalization one. Sure. Sure. Where did my code come from? Land two... I... I mean, now that's just insane. Two layers of Lianalization. Uh, I don't think I'm programmed to count. It actually kind of makes sense one for each of the layers. So the first thing is... And we do so. I zone out almost entirely. Oh, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. At the end of all of the blocks. Sorry, I just got a text from my mom. She'll never find out this way, wink. Boo-woo. No, no, I thought Lianal. You're not kidding about the layers though. Vidal. No one knows what is that. Not, yeah. Um... Okay. Sure, I don't know why we had one to the end of all of them. So I would have thought it's... Oh, no, I do. Yeah, okay. Vidal is lost. Okay, this is looking a lot better now. Lianal, I'm seeing some improved things. This is looking pretty damn good. Like... The It's... it's a twitch chat. You know? Let me... let me increase the max token size to like... multiply this by like... or something. It's what it does. You know, it's pretty easy for chat to just annoyingly talk about how much better I am. Yeah, that's fair. Oh, and he's using Galloway as well. Calls himself pension. That's correct. So Vidal, you'll see on my computer when you type, is that I just auto-complete your sentences and it replaces the words with As. Okay. That was... that was the thing, I believe. There's no need to believe anything. Vidal. I feel... We mentioned this to y'all, and somehow, it's still the same time as when we started that story. My sub-ethan is due to end in an hour, yet I feel like it's been days. I've lost track of time in our endeavors. It's nice to see our hard work paying off, though.
